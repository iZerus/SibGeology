# SibGeology

This is a simple Paper *(Spigot)* plugin that will allow your server's players to find ore deposits more efficiently.

The plugin adds a new functionality to the pickaxe - **the analysis** of nearby ore deposits. Using a pickaxe on a block of stone, the player will be able to find out **the distance** to them. Thus, the player will be able to determine the direction in which to dig to get to **the blocks** of the desired ore.

This plugin helps to increase the interval between server wipes.
